      <p>
        I'm excited to finally learn html and CSS! I've been wanting to persue
        this career path for a long time. I'm in my first semester at BYU Idaho
        and it has been a dream come true.

        One of the things I'm most excited about is building my personal website
        where I can post content: my blog, my videos, my work. I'm a music
        enthusiast and I've been taking the soundtrack from my favorite gaming
        frachise called "The Legend of Zelda" and transcribing them into music
        sheets for the viola. Aa musical instrument that I love and play.
